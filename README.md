## A simple analysis has been done on a given dataset found in https://www.kaggle.com/madhab/jobposts/

### Job Posts dataset
The dataset consists of 19,000 job postings that were posted through the Armenian human resource portal CareerCenter. The data was extracted from the Yahoo! mailing group https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/careercenter-am. This was the only online human resource portal in the early 2000s. A job posting usually has some structure, although some fields of the posting are not necessarily filled out by the client (poster). The data was cleaned by removing posts that were not job related or had no structure. The data consists of job posts from 2004-2015

### Acknowledgements
The data collection and initial research was funded by the American University of Armenia’s research grant (2015).

### Inspiration
The online job market is a good indicator of overall demand for labor in the local economy. In addition, online job postings data are easier and quicker to collect, and they can be a richer source of information than more traditional job postings, such as those found in printed newspapers. The data can be used in the following ways: -Understand the demand for certain professions, job titles, or industries -Help universities with curriculum development -Identify skills that are most frequently required by employers, and how the distribution of necessary skills changes over time -Make recommendations to job seekers and employers

### Past research
We have used association rules mining and simple text mining techniques to analyze the data. Some results can be found here (https://www.slideshare.net/HabetMadoyan/it-skills-analysis-63686238).
